        <div id = "intro_paragraph">
            <p>Fun fact about Feidong (Henry) Song, his first name is actually Feitong 
            not Feidong, but when his mom brought him to get his passport when he was 6, 
            the officer mistakenly put it as Feidong Song. His mom was angry but 
            finally said whatever.
            <p>
            <p>
            Henryâ€™s journey began from Chongqing, China, a city famous for hotpot, 
            then he traveled to Canada to study at Ridley college when he was 13. He 
            is now a Computer Science and Data Science Double major student at UC 
            Berkeley. He is entrepreneurial and so loves to code things that are 
            useful to people. His entrepreneurial spirit is evident from his 
            ventures: founding GPTBang, Inc., a platform harnessing the capabilities 
            of the ChatGPT API and recognized by the CSAC 2023 Spring accelerator 
            program, and co-founding CoffeeTea, Inc., an innovative online marketplace 
            for college students. As Feidong's journey evolved, he recognized the 
            transformative role of technology in shaping the future and decided to 
            channel his energies into academics, with a keen interest in potential 
            AI research.
            </p>
            <p>
            Outside the realm of academics and business, Feidong is passionate about 
            fitness, basketball, and the arts. He's always eager to dive into new 
            experiences, with the singular exception of roller coasters and similar 
            thrill rides.
