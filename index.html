        <p>Feidong (Henry) Song, a dedicated student at the University of California, Berkeley, 
            is pursuing dual majors in Computer Science and Data Science. 
            His entrepreneurial spirit is evident from his ventures: 
            founding GPTBang, Inc., a platform harnessing the capabilities of 
            the ChatGPT API and recognized by the CSAC 2023 Spring accelerator program, 
            and co-founding CoffeeTea, Inc., an innovative online marketplace for 
            college students. As a Software Engineer Intern at WanderFlow, 
            Henry is enhancing mobile application responsiveness and is at the 
            forefront of developing Realcollegeranking.com, a platform set to 
            redefine college rankings. With a keen interest in LLM and its 
            applications, he's actively seeking research opportunities to further 
            expand his academic horizons. Beyond his professional and academic 
            pursuits, Henry's roots trace back to the artistic hub of Chongqing, 
            China, where he was born into an art-loving family. His personal 
            interests also include basketball, having played for one of Canada's top 
            high school teams, 
            showcasing his diverse talents and experiences.</p>
